		<p>National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) is a constituent board of Quality Council of India (QCI), set up to establish and operate accreditation program for healthcare organizations.
		Organisations like the Quality Council of India and its National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers have designed an exhaustive healthcare standard for hospitals and healthcare providers. Hospitals are assessed on over 600 paramaters, the standards are divided between patient centered standards and organization centred standards.To comply with these standard elements, the hospital will need to have a process-driven approach in all aspects of hospital activities â€“ from registration, admission, pre-surgery, peri-surgery and post-surgery protocols, discharge from the hospital to follow up with the hospital after discharge. Not only the clinical aspects but the governance aspects are to process driven based on clear and transparent policies and protocols.
